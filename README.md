Her session was not merely an introduction to new concepts, but a profound journey into the realms of self-discovery and holistic healing.

Dr. Bhatt’s approach to homeopathy emphasized the importance of understanding the individual as a whole, rather than just treating symptoms. Her expertise in meditation counselling provided us with practical tools to manage stress and enhance our mental well-being.

Her words of wisdom inspired us to embrace this new beginning with optimism and determination. Dr. Bhatt’s ability to connect with students on a personal level made her session truly impactful, leaving us motivated to pursue our goals with renewed vigor.

This induction program, marked by Dr. Bhatt’s inspiring presence, set a positive tone for our academic journey ahead.
